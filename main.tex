\opening{Dear Members of the Grant Committee of DisCoTec,}
I am writing you to apply for the Travel Grant to support my attendance at the International Federated Conference on Distributed Computing Techniques (DisCoTec 2024), which will be in Groningen. As a PhD Student in the fields of artificial intelligence and field-based coordination, I believe that attending this conference would be an excellent opportunity for personal growth and would greatly contribute to my ongoing research. Additionally, it would allow me to become a member of the DisCoTec community, providing me with valuable feedback on my work and enabling me to connect with researchers in related fields.
%

Last year, I submitted a tool paper to the COORDINATION conference, namely \emph{ScaRLib: A Framework for Cooperative Many Agent Reinforcement Learning in Scala}, and throughout my research, I often use tools produced by the DAIS community, such as \emph{Alchemist}. Furthermore, this year I submitted a regular paper again to the COORDINATION conference, namely \emph{Field-based Coordination For Federated Learning}. Hence, I believe it would be a great added value to be able to discuss my work with other researchers who will be coming to Groningen.
%

For these reasons, recognized the great value of the conference for my career and for enforcing my connection, I humbly request your support in the form of a travel grant to enable my participation at DisCoTec. Your assistance would alleviate the financial burden and  and enable me to make the most of this valuable opportunity. I am committed to maximizing the impact of this grant and pledge to actively participate in all relevant conference activities, contribute actively to discussion, and submit a detailed report summarizing the key takeaways and insights gained during the conference. 
%

I appreciate the time and consideration given to my application.


\closing{Sincerely,

\textbf{\emph{\Who{}}}
